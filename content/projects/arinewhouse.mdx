My portfolio website is a showcase of my work as a developer. It is built with **Next.js** and **Contentlayer** for handling static content, and **Upstash** for tracking page views.

## Features

- **Dynamic Project Pages:** Each project has its own dynamically generated page with details and view counts.
- **Personalized Details:** The website includes my resume, a contact form, and links to my social media profiles.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
